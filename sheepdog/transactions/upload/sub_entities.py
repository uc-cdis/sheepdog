class FileUploadEntity(UploadEntity):
    """
    Deals with file-like entities.

    As such, this class extends the general UploadEntity class by
    handling the interaction to the index service.

    Like it's parent class:
    The lifespan of a FileUploadEntity should include:
       #. parse
       #. pre_validate
       #. instantiate
       #. post_validate

    Some things to note about data files and the index service:
    - submitter_id/project should be unique per graph node
    - submitter_id/project are used to create an alias in the index service to
        a data file
    - when sheepdog attempts to find out if a file exists in index service it
      has TWO methods of determining
        FIXME At the moment, there is a 1:1 mapping of id's between graph nodes and
              indexed files. eventually, there'll be a file_id attr in the graph node
        1) If a file uuid exists in the graph node or is provided in the submission,
           we can look up that uuid in index service
        2) The hash/file_size combo should be unique in the index service for each
           file

    Here are a few submission examples and how we currently handle. The
    examples here refer to whether or not an "id" field is included during
    the submission.

    - "id" NOT provided , file NOT in index service
        - A new uuid is generated and used for both the graph and indexed file

    - "id" NOT provided , file in index service
        - uuid from the file in the index service is used for the graph id

    - "id" provided     , file NOT in index service
        - id provided is used for the indexed file

    - "id" provided     , file in index service
        - Make sure the uuids match

    ERROR cases handled:
        - If you attempt to submit the same data again with a different "id"
            it will fail. At the moment we are maintaining a 1:1 between indexed
            files and graph nodes
        - Attempting to submit new data (new file) when the node has already
            been created with a previous file will fail. We don't currently
            allow updating the linkage to a new file since we're forcing
            a 1:1 between uuids in graph and index service
