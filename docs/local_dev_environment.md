# Set up a local development environment

This guide will cover setting up a sheepdog development environment.

The cloud settings are still to be determined.

## TODO: Cloud Settings.

* Google (storage / service accounts)
* AWS (storage / auth)
* Azure (to be determined)

## Set up Working Directory

Clone the repo locally.

```console
git clone https://github.com/uc-cdis/sheepdog.git
```

Navigate to the cloned repository directory.

## Set up Python 3

The environment was tested with python 3.8 on WSL1.  You can use `bash` to install python 3 if it's not already available.

```console
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3
```

### Set up a Virtual Environment

Set up a virtual environment for use with this project using `bash`:

```console
python3 -m venv py3-venv
. py3-venv/bin/activate
```

## Set up local Postgresql DB for testing

You can use a local postgresql for testing purposes.

### Set up local Postgresql DB on WSL

You can use `bash` to install postgres:

```console
sudo apt install postgresql-client-common
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'
wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postgresql-12
```

Make sure the cluster is started:

```console
sudo pg_ctlcluster 12 main start
```

### Set up local Postgresql DB on Mac

If you're on mac, you can install postgres using brew:

```console
brew install postgres
```

### Set up DB and users for testing

You'll need to connect to the postgresql and add test users and databases.

#### Connect to Postgresql on WSL

Connect to the local postgresql server

```console
sudo -i -u postgres
psql
```

#### Connect to Postgresql on Mac

If you're on a mac, use the following to connect to postgres:

```console
brew services start postgres
psql postgres
```

#### Helpful psql commands
It may be helpful to understand some psql commands too:

```console
\conninfo # check connection info
\l # list databases
\d # list tables in database
\c # list short connection info
\c postgres # connect to a database named postgres
\q # quit
```

#### Set up users in psql

Initialize a user within the psql console:

```console
CREATE USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'test';
ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'test';
\du
```

## Installation

### Install for General Usage

To install sheepdog for use with other Gen3 services, running these commands is sufficient.

```console
python3 setup.py build
python3 setup.py install
```

### Install for Development

Check the [dev-requirements.txt](https://github.com/uc-cdis/sheepdog/blob/master/dev-requirements.txt) and make sure the requirements includes the following dependencies:

```
coverage==5.3.0
codacy-coverage==1.3.11
```

Install the development requirements with the following commands:

```console
python3 -m pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
python3 setup.py develop
```

Install requirements with pip.

> One of the requirements `dictionaryutils==3.4.0` may not be available through pip, so you can try with a lower available version.  In this case, update [requirements.txt](https://github.com/uc-cdis/sheepdog/blob/master/requirements.txt) to use `dictionaryutils==3.2.0`.  You may also need to update the requirement for `gen3authz==0.2.1` to `gen3authz==0.4.0`.

```console
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Validate Installation

You can try to run the following to confirm installation:

```console
python3 sample-usage.py
```

For convenience, the minimal usage looks like the following:

```python
import sheepdog
import datamodelutils
from flask import Flask
from dictionaryutils import dictionary
from gdcdictionary import gdcdictionary
from gdcdatamodel import models, validators

dictionary.init(gdcdictionary)
datamodelutils.validators.init(validators)
datamodelutils.models.init(models)
blueprint = sheepdog.create_blueprint(name='submission')

app = Flask(__name__)
app.register_blueprint(blueprint)
```

If there's any issues with running the sample, revisit the installation.

> Note that `import sheepdog` relies on building and installing a local python egg for sheepdog, which can be accomplished using `python setup.py build` and `python setup.py install` in the local root directory for the clone repository.

### Generate Documentation

Auto-documentation is set up using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/). To build it, run

```console
cd docs
make html
```

which by default will output the index.html page to docs/build/html/index.html.

> Note that `make` should be available in the console.  For this guide, you can use `make` from WSL1.  You may also find that the *.rst files contain outdated definitions, so remove the definitions before building the documentation.

### Running tests

Before running the tests, make sure your virtual environment already activated.

```console
. py3-venv/bin/activate
```

For convenience, you can run the tests using [run_tests.bash](https://github.com/uc-cdis/sheepdog/blob/master/run_tests.bash).
> You may need to update the virtual environment activation step in the bash script before running it.  You can replace `source ~/virtualenv/python2.7/bin/activate` with `source py3-venv/bin/activate` then run the script with `bash run_tests.bash`.

You can use the following commands from the working directory for cloned repo in order to set up testing:

```console
python3 bin/setup_test_database.py
mkdir -p tests/integration/resources/keys; cd tests/integration/resources/keys; openssl genrsa -out test_private_key.pem 2048; openssl rsa -in test_private_key.pem -pubout -out test_public_key.pem; cd -
```

Then you can run the following for pytest:

```console
python3 -m pytest -vv --cov=sheepdog --cov-report xml tests/integration/datadict
python3 -m pytest -vv --cov=sheepdog --cov-report xml --cov-append tests/integration/datadictwithobjid
python3 -m pytest -vv --cov=sheepdog --cov-report xml --cov-append tests/unit
```
